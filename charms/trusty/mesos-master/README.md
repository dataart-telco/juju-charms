#What is Mesos?
###A distributed systems kernel

Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

##Mesos Features

  - Scalability to 10,000s of nodes
  - Fault-tolerant replicated master and slaves using ZooKeeper
  - Support for Docker containers
  - Native isolation between tasks with Linux Containers
  - Multi-resource scheduling (memory, CPU, disk, and ports)
  - Java, Python and C++ APIs for developing new parallel applications
  - Web UI for viewing cluster state

# Overview

This charm install Mesos based on Mesosphere's packages and instructions. Refer to: [Mesosphere mesos cluster instalation instructions](https://open.mesosphere.com/getting-started/datacenter/install/)

## Charm features:

  - Runs mesos master (standalone and cluster modes)
  - Runs Marathon
  - Option to install zookeeper
  - Option to run mesos slave on same machine
  - Option to install docker
  - Option to install mesos-dns

# Usage

    juju deploy mesos-master
    juju expose mesos-master

### Endepoints

Mesos web ui: http://<server ip>:5050
Marathon: http://<server ip>:8080

For full description of the options refer to:

  - [Mesosphere mesos master configuration](https://open.mesosphere.com/reference/mesos-master/)
  - [Mesosphere mesos slave configuration](https://open.mesosphere.com/reference/mesos-slave/)
  - [Apache Mesos documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/configuration/)

  - [Apache Zookeeper configuration](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_configuration)
  - [Mesos-dns configuration](https://mesosphere.github.io/mesos-dns/docs/configuration-parameters.html)

### This Charm is in beta and not all mesos-slave options are available at the moment. Let me know if you require any option or feel free to contribute.

## Known Limitations and Issues

#### Local Provider Blockers

 The Docker Charm will not work out of the box on the
 [local provider](https://jujucharms.com/docs/config-local). LXC containers are goverend by a
 very strict [App Armor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor)
 [policy](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html#lxc-apparmor) that prevents accidental
 misuses of privilege inside the container. Thus **running the mesos-slave Charm with docker containerizer
 inside the local provider is not a supported deployment method**.
